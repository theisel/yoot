## About

This application serves as a practical showcase for the [`yoot`](https://github.com/theisel/yoot) library and its adapters. The goal is to provide a clear, hands-on understanding of `yoot` in real-world scenarios. It demonstrates:

- **Adapter integration:** Registering CDN adapters.
- **Preset usage:** Defining and applying reusable transformation sets.
- **Core transformations:** Common image operations like resizing and fitting.
- **Multi-framework rendering:** Using `yoot` with React, Svelte, Solid, and Vue components within an Astro project.

&nbsp;

## Showcasing

Key `yoot` features highlighted:

- **CDN Adapters:**
  - `@yoot/cloudinary`
  - `@yoot/imgix`
  - `@yoot/sanity`
  - `@yoot/shopify`
- **Transformation Presets:** For `square`, `landscape`, and `portrait` aspects.
- **Fit Modes:** Comparison of `fit('cover')` vs. `fit('contain')`.
- **API Usage:** `yoot` initialization, chaining methods, and preset application.
